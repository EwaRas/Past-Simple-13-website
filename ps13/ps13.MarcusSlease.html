                        <em><strong>Act One, Scene One</strong></em><br><br>
                        A crow descends. It flies around the cave in a hungry spirit. It pulls it beak over its head and becomes the shadow of man. Then the snows fall and the squirrels tuck in their nuts for the winter.  The crowman tries to dig up the nuts but the nuts are no longer there. A round bear snores. The crowman sneaks around the bear. Clawing the ground for grub. But the grub is in the bear’s belly. Tucked away for the winter. Crowman changes back into a crow and flies towards the mountains. The trees bend and wave in the wind. Out of the trees there is much clomping of monsters. <br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Two, Scene Two</strong></em><br><br>
                        Near the shoreline two women are snapping peach schnapps and the whales are snorting water from their snort holes. Along the promenade there are shadow mouths moving in many languages. One woman stops to try on a hat made of hemp with a small yellow rose. Above the right eye. The hemp is strong and also bushy. It pushes out her face. It is more round and also sunny. The second woman approves. They stroll back down the promenade.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Three, Scene Three</strong></em><br><br>
                        The kiosks are covered in white flakes and ice puddles are flaking into sharp daggers. A faceless man divvies up the bounties. He has scratched all the scratch cards. No winners. The loose coins jangle in his pocket. The numbers are soldiers. Lined up in a row in the ledger. All is in order. He pulls down the lid on the kiosk.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Four, Scene Four</strong></em><br> <br>
                        The king is broadcasting from the throne room. Winter is coming. The country has dripped its paint. The king is telling the country the other country is not in line. The other country cannot have its independence. The other country drips it yellow colors. The red and yellow want to remain separate. The red and yellow want to mix together. The yellow is smaller than the red but pulls more weight than the rest of the country. The yellow wants to feel loved and appreciated. The red sends it armies to prevent the yellow from voting. You cannot vote they say. You are red first and yellow second. The yellow feels underappreciated. Some of the yellows want yellow first and red second. Some of the yellows want red first and yellow second. Some of the yellows want to mix the red and the yellow. Some of the yellows just don’t know. Crows circle the chimneys.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Five, Scene Five</strong></em><br><br>
                        The houses are risen by a puff of air underneath them. The puff of air raises the houses by 50%. Many people cannot afford them or go into debt to get them. The bicycles descend by robotic arm underneath the ground to store them. Everything is space saving. The average work week is 60 hours. No one has time except for work and after work drinking with work partners. The number of people dying from work increases. Some of the work kings suggest half Fridays. 2% of the island population get a half Friday. They only work 55 hours per week. There is no time for families. The population decreases by 10 million. More work equals less families equals less humans equals save the world from extinction. All the countries increase their work weeks. This prolongs the human experiment and also the misery.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Six, Scene Six</strong></em><br><br>
                        Waterfront property increases by 500% in one year<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Seven, Scene Seven</strong></em><br><br>
                        A hat picks up speed. It blows across the prairies, flatlands, highlands, swamplands. It doesn’t sink. Very soon it sits on top of the head of a man with a cleft. The cleft is a small crater and the man is from another planet. He tries and tries and tries. The crowd is very loud and he doesn’t want a Pontius Pilate.  This cleft man moves into the forest to become a hermit. Many years pass. The wind howls. The snow piles. The trees could fall down on the hermit hut any minute. One day he gets an emotional haircut and moves back into the world of human monsters. He becomes a mascot of the disaffected. He fathers children with emotional goddesses. <br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Eight, Scene Eight</strong></em><br><br>
                        They install greenery on the walls and also the rooftops. They try to pinken the lungs. The wealthy move into the greenery. The beehives swarm from the rooftops. The wealthy drive up the prices. They pile it in the middle and the puddle spreads out wider and wider. The non-wealthy only get a ripple. They live further and further from the center. They spend most of their time riding various public transportation to the center. The cleft man saws logs and makes hammocks. Sells them to chain stores. He lives in the new community of fairies and witches. There is a job for everyone. Gardeners and coaches and cooks and children minders. Everyone gets pocket money on the weekends. The tribal leaders keep the children warm in their belly. The cleft man fathers cleft children. The fairies and witches endow the children with magic. Many generations turn over.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Nine, Scene Nine</strong></em><br><br>
                        The vegetable workers and scientists get together. They form a super vegetable. It gets bigger and bigger. The children of the children of children of children of the cleft man and witches and fairies grow taller and taller. The dragons move closer and closer. At the last minute they retreat back into the forest. They create a new ecosystem built of magic. And also peas.<br><br>
                        <em><strong>Act Ten, Scene Ten</strong></em><br><br>
                        The crowman pulls down his hat. It changes into a beak. The crowman pulls up its beak. It changes into a hat. And so it goes.
