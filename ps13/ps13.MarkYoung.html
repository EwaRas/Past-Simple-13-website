                        So that, coming back,
                        he could find his
                        way, he laid down
                        markers. Pistachios
                        from his pocket. The 
                        Greek alphabet. Words
                        chosen at random.<br>
                        Such variety. Slept 
                        when he got to where 
                        he was going. Came
                        back in sunlight, found 
                        food on the journey. 
                        Thought about his 
                        place in the scheme<br>
                        of things as he walked 
                        his way from omega
                        down to alpha. The 
                        words were redundantâ€” 
                        though sometimes he 
                        picked them up, made 
                        poems out of them.

                <pre>
                        When power plants throw 
                        away the same amount of
                        waste heat as the energy 
                        they generate, a search for a <br>
                        fixed point is pure instru-
                        mental indulgence. So many 
                        targets; no way to tell 
                        when the process will end <br>
                        if one begins considering 
                        spiritual questions seriously. 
                        On the cooling pond black 
                        swans glide by. A harpist <br>
                        plays Pachelbel's <em>Canon 
                        in D Minor</em>. A man &amp; a
                        woman share a telephone 
                        line. They despise each other.

                <pre>
                        I brought my dog on a cool
                        day. 1060 people were here
                        in the sweeping lobby of 
                        the hotel. It took my breath <br>
                        away. Most of these slaves 
                        were once held in New York: 
                        a new trafficking reality is 
                        challenging; the geographical <br>
                        scope of activity has been
                        expanded to explore new 
                        markets. Incoherent realities 
                        out of a nation that thinks <br>
                        itself civilized. Weiner's
                        phrase no longer a Legerian 
                        depiction of the geometry of 
                        an excursion to the beach. Now<br>
                        become a symbol for sex worker
                        solidarity. Begun with a march 
                        at the Venice Biennale. Carried
                        on under the red umbrella.
