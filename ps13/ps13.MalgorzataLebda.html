                    <h4><strong>Easter field blessing: division</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                    we go with father to the fields we hold small crosses <br class="noBreakMobile">of hazel and paper ribbons and holy water (in plastic <br class="noBreakMobile">bottles) our dogs run along fat with shiny fur <br class="noBreakMobile">they scare foxes from between the birches<br>
                    father pushes the cross into the stony ground <i>bloody flysch</i> he says <br class="noBreakMobile">and I think that in a few months in the August heat<br class="noBreakMobile">we’ll be harvesting wheat here (it is here that father will first <br class="noBreakMobile"> tell us about death he’ll put on it the mask of the forest)<br>
                    down in the village the church bells ring
                    we return from the last field
                    each of us tries to hold
                    father’s attention on herself<br>
                    in the light of a tall bonfire I consider
                    the way we divide him between us: uneven
                    unjust
                </pre>
                    <h4><strong>matters of the forest: diagnosis</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                    <i>at the start I spoke to you
                    as to animals but when your questions
                    turned uncomfortable I watched
                    you more carefully<br>
                    I thought I’d show the one first
                    to ask about the matters of the forest
                    everything with precision
                    till first blood</i>
                </pre>
                    <h4><strong>face: painting lesson</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                    near the forest died father’s old friend
                    we used to visit him in winter his hands resembled <br class="noBreakMobile">the claws of a bird of prey he poured onto clay saucers <br class="noBreakMobile">honeydew and clapped seeing our faces sticky with sweetness<br>
                    he whispered because as father claimed in his throat <br class="noBreakMobile">settled evil so if we were to pray we should pray for his throat <br class="noBreakMobile">and against what lived there<br>
                    <i>he gave me my first bees</i> father says while we walk <br class="noBreakMobile">up the fields to touch his hand one last time<br>
                    in the cold room I’m peering at the dried face
                    of the friend of my father I’m thinking of death’s
                    painterly ambition how it brings forth shadow
                    how cautiously it selects colour
                </pre>
                    <h4><strong>June: blood</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                    I find my sister in the kitchen her head bent over the sink <br class="noBreakMobile">from her nose streaks dense blood the red line leads <br class="noBreakMobile">across the floor to the sofa I push back her forehead <br class="noBreakMobile">with a kitchen cloth wipe her mouth<br>
                    father enters the hall with a bleeding hare
                    takes my sister’s face into his hands I see the blood <br class="noBreakMobile">of the animal and the blood of my sister mix
                </pre>
                    <h4><strong>inventory: birth and slaughter</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                    whitewashed wall of the cowshed turns into father’s notebook <br class="noBreakMobile">with a drafting pencil he jots down dates of the insemination <br class="noBreakMobile">of the cows he counts the animals coming and going<br>
                    in the evening we take a heifer to a bull
                    father chooses the one near the forest the Swiss Simmental breed <br class="noBreakMobile">the bull seems enormous from his nostrils dangles a cast-iron ring <br class="noBreakMobile">I ask father if he won’t break the cow <i>he’s gentle</i> father assures<br>
                    the boys who live near the forest take me to the barn to its doors <br class="noBreakMobile">where they have nailed toads <i>we’re praying <br class="noBreakMobile">to them</i> they say bowing deep to the amphibians
