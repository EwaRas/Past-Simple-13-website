                <h4><strong>Only Fragile Left Alive</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                        The sallow sheep. Men covered in bristle. Men shaved of it,
                        against recent habits. All from the northern counties.
                        Some from the southern.<br>
                        None of the forgetful.
                        Maybe some of the inquisitive (I doubt)
                        No birds shitting lime. Surely, not women that sailed under different colors, so far.
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>Magic or Medicine</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                        Four people meet in the Schindler’s
                        cabin. <br>
                        The Officer speaks of machines. Last night, he watched a film with his wife, and knows how to touch her.
                        The Counsel wants to recall<br>
                        the problem he already faced. No names. From despair, he’s saved
                        by a message: sea bass for dinner.<br>
                        Barbara must check if children had the vaccination – 
                        on time? What if out of it? It’s such a risk to grow up with someone<br>
                        who thinks she is a red balloon.
                        (In thoughts, I flow to you, it’s needless and obsolete)
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>A Lone Thumb Our Caliban Was</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                        Two women at the table: a blonde in pearls and a brunette, in fact a black one,
                        unadorned. If you don’t get inspired
                        by people you dine with, don’t follow my advice.<br>
                        The blonde was hanging lanterns 
                        in the garden before. The brunette, in fact the black one, watched them. 
                        In our part of the globe, fortunately, we fear the pioneers. 
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>The Cloud</strong></h4>
                    <pre>
                        One of the punishments recommended on four-year-olds 
                        is the <i>Cloud</i>. You go into it.
                        Sit cross-legged. <br>
                        You weep or, quite contrary, temper yourself,
                        with all these witnesses. Never for what’s physiological. 
                        Usually for lies.<br>
                        Helmut Kohl and Gerhard Schroeder encouraged 
                        Germans to pee sitting. 
                        They were helped by misses.<br>
                        Two million automatic reproaches. 
                        For them – to kindly consider – all the opportunities –
                        they were surrounded by.<br>
                        The Germans sat on the cold porcelain and recalled their sins
                        against women. (They weren’t kindly asked for this)
                        The clouds swelled outside the windows, and ran, ran away.
