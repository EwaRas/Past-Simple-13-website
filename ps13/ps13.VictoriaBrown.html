                    This room is multiple potted ferns. It is wicker furniture. It is woven, peacock chair with pastel green, leaf pattern on white background cushioning. It is where you would leave an orange flavoured cocktail, with a straw and a paper umbrella, half drunk on a chevron - designed, glass-topped, bamboo coffee table, which also has under-shelving for magazines. The bamboo table will take the weight of an average sized naked woman if she is on her knees with her legs slightly open. The floor is rattan rugs and a large bowl containing at least one exotic fruit, such as a pineapple, amongst other more common fruits such as apples.  The table and the chair are placed so that if a woman, wearing only silver, high-heeled sandals and a grey chiffon scarf, sits there she can easily swing her leg over the arm and awkwardly rest her foot on the table-top. If a woman then sits on the floor with her back against the chair, she is able to easily reach her orange cocktail.<br>

                <h4>Lucy of Abingdon</h4>
                <div id="prose"><p>
                    Lucy was in the living room. It was newly decorated. It was the first room they had decorated in their new house. They had chosen the wallpaper together. They got married on her 27th birthday. Everybody said it was a good idea because they would never forget when their anniversary was. They did the decorating in the new house themselves, after the wedding. Lucy did the painting. Skirting boards, window ledges and door frames. Lucy’s husband did the wallpapering. It didn't take long, just an afternoon. Afterwards they went out for a few drinks. Lucy didn't mind that she had paint on her hands and some in her hair even though she was in a pub on a Saturday night. The wallpaper was non-woven, smooth surface, matt look with stylised blossoms. Basic colour: cream. Pattern colour: dark grey, yellow green, light grey. Dimensions: 0.52 m × 10.05 m. Pattern repeat: 0.38m. Straight match. Grammage: 151 g/m2. Characteristics: good lightfastness, low flammability, strippable, wash-resistant.<br><br>
                    So far she had taken off her blouse and skirt so she was only wearing her underwear. Black underwire bra with flower lace cups, size 32B, sheer bikini briefs with flower lace edge, size medium, sheer nylon black stockings with decorative trim, matching garter belt for that tantalizing look and feeling. Lucy’s husband suggested she buy them last weekend. She thought she looked good, even though she had a bruise on her thigh from moving all the boxes into the new house. Lucy’s husband said it didn't matter because these photos were 'real life'. She was lying on the settee. It used to be her sister's. It was a bit worn on the arms but it was still pretty good. Large swirling leaf pattern in white, black and grey raised chenille fabric. Not believed to be fire retardant.<br><br> Lucy's husband’s new hobby was photography.  He bought a Pentax K1000. He wanted Pentax because he said that "Pentax glass was the best". Lucy didn't know how he knew that. The Pentax used a horizontal travel, rubberized silk cloth focal plane shutter with a speed range of 1/1000 second to 1 second, along with bulb and a flash X-sync of 1/second. 91.4 millimetres tall, 143 mm wide, 48 mm deep, and 620 grams. The body was finished in black leather with chrome trim only, although early production Pentax K1000 SE bodies had brown leather with chrome trim.<br><br> Lucy's husband suggested pulling off one stocking while he took another photograph. He was using Agfacolour Special 120, 16 exposures. He put the standard lamp on to adjust the lighting. Lucy undid all the little suspender bits and then pulled the stocking off. She paused halfway to look into the Pentax K1000. He said "look like you're feeling very passionate." Once they had that photo, they could move onto the bra.</p></div>

                    During the lunch break, when Pat and Micki served cold meats, salad, cheeses and chilled white wine, Selina revealed her secret, it would be the ultimate turn-on. A free trip to Galaxy Studios to take an ace lensman up on his suggestion that they make Kodak instamatic film together.<br><br>Who could forget Angie, for example, or Mrs T, or trim, petite Louise of Worthing? Here’s another brave reader, wide-eyed and bubbling over with life, a double dish of delight. A secret desire to pose for a professional, the final bare-all picture, got to be sexy-fun'.
