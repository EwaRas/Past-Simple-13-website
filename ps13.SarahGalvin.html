            <h4 >THE FOUR SEASONS</h4><br>
                 <div id="prose"><p>
                    Often I wake up to the gray lozenge of sky out the window of my apartment and think, “I just want to rip my
                    skin off,” and there they are, between the recycling bins--the “I Want to Rip My Skin Off” dancers. In pastel
                    tulle and leotards tight over their various enticing lumps, they do high kicks and thrust in unison until I
                    remember it’s spring, and run outside to gather all the flowers and birds and shove them up my ass.
                </p></div>
            <h4>IT’S NOT REALLY RATIONAL TO BLAME ANYONE FOR THE PAIN IN YOUR LIFE</h4><br>
                 <div id="prose"><p>
                    Your parents had awful lives too. You can breathe deeply from your diaphragm and focus on that picture of your
                    wife and imagine what it would be like if she was sometimes three inches tall like in the photo so you could fit
                    her completely inside your mouth for a moment, until you become fashion. You are fashion now. “Fuck you,
                    I’m a fancy coat,” you can say. Fashion is all about getting up at 6 am to steal newspapers off peoples’ porches
                    and replace them with fabric samples. It’s about pretending the best asses fit completely in your mouth
                    sometimes even when they’re huge. It’s about deep breathing and wadding all the newspapers into a giant ass.
                    You are a fancy coat and your parents are the space that was there before that coat existed.

            <h4>UNLIMITED CLEAN EGGS</h4><br>
                 <div id="leftJustify"><p>
                    “Hot egg power hose massage $1,500<br>
                    unlimited clean eggs”<br>
                    was a real ad that we posted together<br>
                    that was how I found out you know the secret which is<br>
                    that watching your entire family suddenly decay<br>
                    is actually kind of funny<br>
                    when a Rod Stewart song is playing.<br><br>
                    The purpose of dancing is writing the secret,<br>
                    but hardly anyone understands that language.<br><br>
                    We get shitfaced at a party attended by everyone<br>
                    who has ever hurt us<br>
                    our bodies moving in unison<br>
                    to the increasingly stupid music,<br>
                    and as we intentionally twirl into one<br>
                    of those trays of pale flavorless raw vegetables and ranch dressing<br>
                    my only thought is your eyeliner smells fantastic,<br>
                    I didn’t know eyeliner could smell like anything.<br>
                </p></div>
            <h4>BLACK LIGHT POSTER</h4><br>
                 <div id="prose"><p>
                    People think it’s bad to be exclusively interested in sex, but the exclusiveness of my interest allowed me the
                    only known escape from despair—becoming a black light poster. A black light poster continuously incandesces
                    a single image--a unicorn, a crystal ball, etc—in in colors equivalent to the sound of an airhorn. I blast an
                    airhorn so everyone looks at me and then yell, “I CAME HERE TO FUCK.” A fluorescent two-dimensional
                    representation of a crystal ball conveys only one message: “I AM A CRYSTAL BALL.” Those colors can only
                    signify one thing at a time.
                </p></div>
            <h4>MR. TITSKY</h4><br>
                 <div id= "prose"><p>
                    I go up on the roof to talk to Mr. Titsky. He is the funniest person in the world, but I’m the only one who can see
                    him. The roof reminds me of the treehouse where I used to hide from my insane drunk mom as a child. All my
                    favorite things were there, wrinkled from the rain. I warned Mr. Titsky about the rain but every time I see him
                    he’s more wrinkled. He doesn’t care, he’s the funniest person in the world.
                </p></div>
            <h4>IT’S SO HARD TO GET ANYTHING DONE, KNOWING THAT HISTORY HAPPENED</h4><br>
                 <div id="prose"><p>
                    When everyone was playing pianos with their elbows and having threesomes with Buddy Holly and giving the
                    neighbors shoeboxes of their own poop as presents. I’ll admit all I know about history is from Little Richard’s
                    biography, but that admission does nothing to solve the problems of the present, like finding the neighbors. I’ve
                    been walking around with this shoebox for so long I don’t remember where I live. But sometimes I hear piano
                    from an open window and I stand immersed in the music like a liquid, outside of time, just glad my box isn’t
                    empty.
