                        She likes the taste of her knee. In the summer, she eats it straight off the skin; in the winter,<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        through the stockings, until the cotton fur moults on her tongue. In her head perched on her<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        knee the child arranges the familiar things.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                    	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ant rubbed between the fingers smells of vinegar. The butterfly has powder. The<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        mole, a tuxedo. Grey curds of dirt can be rolled up and down the skin. Old people stink of<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        borscht. Behind the fingernails is butter entered smoothly by splinters. People may be hunch-<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        backed or mad, but not so dogs and birds. Sucking on her salty knee, the child knows: the<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        only thing that separates man from the world is skin. Thanks to it we don’t sink into the<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        boundlessness of things.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>

                        Grandmother grows her mother in a room with half a door. The other half she has sawn off to <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        be able to see what the old hag is up to. The half with the lock remains. She turns the key and <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        drops it into her bra. She won’t give it to anyone. Won’t let this plague cross the threshold. <span class="fullSpan"></span><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week she took her eyes off her only for a moment: great-grandmother cut up the <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        curtains, stuffed a bag of sugar into the stove. She thought it was coal – both are hard. She <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        gutted the wardrobe in search of her school uniform. She’s ninety, can’t remember her own <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        name, but the uniform, the apron with the straps that crossed at her back, she could. If she’s <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        not locked up, she’ll turn everything upside down. <br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'You’re strangely quiet, mum,’ grandmother calls out to the hole between the door frames.<span class="fullSpan"></span><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I shat on myself,’ the head pops up above the rigid line of the cut door.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You have to wait.’ <br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandmother won’t drop what she’s doing. She won’t burn the meat. When you have<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        madness under your roof, the rest must remain normal. Good dinner belongs in that rest. <span class="fullSpan"></span><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jumper flies into the kitchen. Followed by skirt, underskirt, bra. <br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Excuse me, could you call my daughter? I’m standing naked here.’<br> <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I’m coming. I am your daughter.’ <br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘No, you’re not. My daughter has black hair and she’s slim like a stem. This thin,’ two<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        fingers clench a centimetre of air above the door. ‘Your hair is grey and you’re fat.’ <span class="fullSpan"></span><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandmother changes the nappy on her mother. The velcro crackles on the hips.<br> <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I can die, if you pay me well,’ says the old baby.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grandmother brings a bag full of linen buttons. She spills them on the floor.<br> <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Enough?’<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I’m not sure, I need to count.’<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        I’m sitting with great-grandmother on the floor. We’re counting the buttons on our fingers.<span class="fullSpan"></span><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Have you ever seen so much money?’ asks great-grandmother. <br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she’s not looking, I stuff the buttons into my shoes, drop them behind my <span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        blouse, swallow them. To make them fewer. Too few for death.<br> <span class="fullSpan"></span>

                <h4>Windowsill</h4>
                    <div class="textJustifiedNowicka">
                        Women, before they squeeze into the queue, sit their children on the windowsills. At the<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        butcher’s there are big windows that drip flies. The flies drop off the panes, because they had<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        too much to eat or are too old. They’re lying and drying up. Flies are good for making things.<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        The big ones with shiny wings can be arranged into strings of beads. The fat ones can be shot<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        at the thin ones to knock them down to the ground. I’ve collected a fistful. The women peck<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        at my fist. Their stares are hungry for my flies. Like hens, they take quick strides, but don’t<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        go anywhere. Raise and drop their necks to see the meat thrown onto the slab. Heads up: a<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        side of beef is carved. Heads down: metal balls on the purses click. The women scratch the<span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        small coins with their claws.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Move on, on on on.’<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They take: legs, lungs, heart.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Whose heart?’ asks a boy bored with counting the flies.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nylon nets of their shopping bags stretch. The bellies and breasts prod the backs.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Move on on on.’<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those first in the queue can see the prices – they pass the how much much much back<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        to the blind rest. One hen wants to jump the queue. She has a huge egg under her dress.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Let her through, otherwise she’ll lay her egg here.’<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decide never to become a woman. Even if I cut my first breasts, they’ll fall out, like<span class="fullSpan"></span> 
                        milk teeth.<br><span class="fullSpan"></span>
