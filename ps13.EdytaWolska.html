                    Edyta Wolska is a graduate of the Academy of Fine Arts in Poznań. She is a visual artist. She works in painting, photography, video, objects and installations. She uses her work as a means to reflect on the surrounding reality. For her, art is identical with life, and the human being comes to the fore of her considerations. She makes comments on reality, relating to problems faced by individual persons, such as: intolerance, ostracism, lack of communication, loneliness, the quest for identity and for ultimate meanings. She has taken part in numerous individual and group exhibitions in Poland and abroad (Germany, Japan). She lives and works in Słupsk and Ustka. Since 2006, she has been a director of the Baltic Gallery of Contemporary Art in Słupsk. The artist is also a member of the jury at the Polish Biennial of Young Art ‘Fish Eye’ and, since 2006, curator for exhibitions of entries in this competition; in 2009 she was the curator of the festival of contemporary art “Ustka Sztuki” and of the exhibition entitled ‘Pictures from Memory’ (Obrazy z pamięci) in the Städtische Galerie Burgerhaus Szwabach in Germany in 2010. She has co-ordinated the following events: the International Symposium on Poetic Realities (Międzynarodowe Sympozjum Realności Poetyckich, 2006); Discontextuum-visions-shadows-meditations (Discontextuum-wizje-cieniemedytacje), with participating artists from the USA, 2006; International Session of Manifestations (Międzynarodowa Sesja Manifestacje, 2007); and ‘Boundlessness of the Sky’ (Ten bezmiar nieba) – a group exhibition of Japanese artists, members of the A 21 International Art Exhibition from Osaka; among others. She helped co-ordinate the exhibition, ‘The Power of Fantasy. Modern Art. From Poland’ in the Bozar Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels. She initiated and co-ordinated numerous educational projects, including an artistic workshop called Alphabet of Art and a film workshop entitled ‘My Street’ (Moja ulica), which were organised by the Baltic Gallery of Contemporary Art in Słupsk with projects supported by the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.
