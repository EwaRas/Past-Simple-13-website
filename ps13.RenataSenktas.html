                <h4><strong>Very much</strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        Today, I'd wind my way towards tongues
                        where the past is a very short word
                        written and pronounced the same, keeping a certain
                        consistency during all those backwards tugs.<br>
                        The same with the past of others
                        As when you tap me on the arm
                        and I turn, the wave is just rolling back
                        and I can study its sharp fingers, lines,<br>
                        threads of foam which will quicker vanish
                        than let themselves be tangled up. To tie them 
                        somehow with those bathing a few feet away
                        is not easy either, more of them since yesterday<br>
                        It's easier with that ridge of rocks on the shore
                        which is today risen above. Sit down,
                        this is a very serious ocean,
                        you won't wade any further, don't go in, it says,<br>
                        it is me who is wooing you.
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>Explain, translate</strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        transport me to the other side
                        of the day, after noon, or else along
                        this narrow balk, which (look down)
                        could appear to be a river<br>
                        or move from the first to the second
                        half of this page. These are not two capitals
                        in neighbouring states furthest
                        from each other.<br>
                        Because, say, to really winter the days
                        when in Europe not all the
                        chestnuts are completely diseased
                        and the tongue draws tissue samples<br>
                        from some prehistoric shape?
                        And maybe it was rhythm? Ah,
                        to become all ears!
                        Because come evening (which sounds like ring-<br>
                        ring) I waited for your car to arrive,
                        but maybe it was a phone call, and if these phrases
                        do not intersect, if this is how it is to be,
                        then this is how it seems it will be.
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>Studio</strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        A joining of fire and earth
                        does not preclude union. Look,
                        see how the elements pass by in order,
                        see how the elements pass by in disorder.<br>
                        They say: join in pairs
                        things identical, join dots
                        with lines, how to draw stars –
                        practice by tracing arrows.<br>
                        Meanwhile, here is a carton full of “mix
                        following fire”, down below, in a room
                        “various papers, mostly nothing”.
                        This mixture is itself,<br>
                        as long as you keep it moving,
                        you might be moved by this stream
                        of words, a window shape which wavers
                        according to the sun's measures<br>
                        and a naked lightbulb: there is a desk,
                        a low ceiling, glass, a tall barrier,
                        its absence, and more steps,
                        that clay-filled bathtub,<br>
                        which has its rhyme, that photo,
                        that thermometer, a nut tree, nuts, he,
                        needles prised from walls
                        (because they weren't leaves)<br>
                        that's not all –
                        sculpting shores, most capably
                        that salt, mountain of solid. After noon
                        it's like burning coals.<br>
                        Will it turn to ash? And who will gather
                        it in handfuls? Scatter across the ice?
                        Will someone wrap it in a coat?
                        “Fragile. Handle with care”.
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>Two Snaps from Otwock</strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        And so you see, who will believe
                        in reprints, sources?<br>
                        An acacia grove: this is the house
                        where he once lived. It is no longer here.<br>
                        An upended pine tree, sand, tyre tracks:
                        and this was to be yours, Mine –
                        you say – and then it's gone from you.
