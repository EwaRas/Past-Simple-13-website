                        for seven years and a lot of the lab fridges are just the same type as ordinary kitchen fridges. Little under-the-counter iceboxes, yeah with a place to put your eggs but instead they’re full of routine specimens, full of white-topped
                        universals, full of sputums, bronchial washes, voided urine, pleural fluid, peritoneal washings, pericardial fluids &lpar;I worked in fluids&rpar;, synovials, fine needle aspirations, cerebral spinal fluids &lpar;weak and built-up
                        with albumen&rpar;. More white-topped universals containing haematuria stained urine – pink, red or cola-coloured urine. I was saying. I was saying only last weekend that I liked your solo exhibition of paintings with Hawaii-blue
                        waves. The Chinese tourists are here these past few decades and the world's biggest illegal outdoor rave will be broken up. The Chinese men and women running away from police and underneath Michael Stipe &lpar;Track 3 of ‘Murmur’&rpar;.
                        It’s like a re-enactment. A re-re-enactment. Footage of this&quest; Footage. What people used to think of as a determination of reality. What happened&quest; Chicken fucker. You chicken fucker. Chickenfucker. Chicken fucker. You're
                        for it. Wrestle me you fucker, chicken fucker, he said. I didn’t like his tone. An encampment of buses near to where I grew up. Following the convoy. It became known as <i>the</i> convoy. The police descended and began. Men, women
                        and children led away shivering, swearing, crying, bleeding. Such an irrational number. They turned everyone against each other. They turned everyone against each other but it wasn't. It wasn't difficult. When I was young I espoused
                        what they would call a philosophy. Standing in a field of poppies as tall as her shoulders. Standing relatively close. Mistakes I've made. Oh yes. Fuck head. You've got a weak head if this is your recent body. If this is your recent
                        body of work. This is what you do&quest; You feel it's a race? Yes&quest; It's not a race. It’s just doing activities but then they rearrange the furniture and they don’t empty the ashtray of cigarette butts but instead they fill
                        the ashtrays with real cigarette butts and they don’t even. They don’t even smoke. All inspired by childhood memories. Which we do care about. </p>

                    <p class="proseParagraph">“So while neuroscientists struggle to understand how there can ever be such a thing as a first-person reality, quantum physicists have to grapple with the mystery of how there can be anything but a first-person reality.” <br> <br>
                        <strong>Amanda Gefter, ‘The Case Against Reality’, <i>The Atlantic, 2016</i> </strong><br><br> “I think I’m dumb. Maybe just happy. Think I’m just happy”<br><br>
                        <strong>Nirvana, ‘Dumb’, 1993</strong><br><br> It's gonna be unreal she says. You guys are definitely unreal. We'll try and give em something they won't forget says Journey in her calm Cork burr. She's using her Irish accent. This
                        is the one she picked up in Little Ireland. She continues, "1993 was a blank cheque and we wrote on it". <br><br> Cigarette Girl watches Journey on the screen. Journey has made a viral video and now she is saying these things on
                        the video soundtrack. Cigarette Girl tries to think of words to describe Journey and chooses bellicose and pugnacious. She is happy with these words. Girl at End is in the background composing hardcore industrial lullabies of the
                        heart. James is in the foreground. He tries to appear glum and disheveled but he can't help but look rich. He won't be allowed in with the cool working class people tonight. Journey cuts away from the two of them and starts a montage
                        sequence. She soundtracks it with a song by Rollerskate Skinny.<br><br> Journey uses a VHS video style transition that is supposed to be like 'Who taped over my video?' and now it's the 80s and it's skinny ties and it's wraparound
                        sunglasses and it's Jane Wiedlin and Cigarette Girl thinks they should have made a TV show about the Go-Go's like they made one about The Monkees. There could be an episode about when Billy Joel hit on Charlotte.<br><br> Boom comes
                        in and hands a coffee to Cigarette Girl. She takes it awkwardly, nearly dropping her phone, the video goes from landscape to portrait and then landscape again as she steadies herself. She tries to angle it so Boom can see. Boom
                        is non-committal. He's loosened up though these days. Nowadays Boom will admit to being slightly influenced by The Velvet Underground but generally he's known to be very taciturn about what influences him.<br><br> "That's an international
                        lie", says video Journey as the real Journey comes up behind. Cigarette Girl and knocks her gently in the back sending her coffee into the turmoil. She speaks in her normal accent now. Her voice emerges as a polite, soul-coated
                        techno beat, "Where's my coffee" she says to Boom. </p>

                        her in her hand. Hers is a present time.<br><br> Back at the ranch, Nino looks up bleary eyed from his work crafting deluxe-edition prize-winning drum machines for the next generation and it's been ten years.
                        He pens careful narratives for each preset sequence. This one is based on his sister running through a forest with a girl he once dated, it consists of a snare and kick drum, 16th note hi-hats and some ghost snares added for extra

More and more, he feels Journey is becoming like one of those Japanese girls in silver helmets who nod streams of visitors
                        into the Palace of Electricity. He wonders if everything he is doing is wrong and if Journey has been right all along. It’s like he’s still absorbed in the arcane mysteries of John McEnroe's service game whilst she plugs away at
                        the future.<br></p>
