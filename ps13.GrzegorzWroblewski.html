                        it’s drizzling again
                        I fall asleep
                        … a can of tuna
                        with some water
                        I wake up
                        and fall asleep

                        All I could see were gray stockings
                        and slightly worn, brown
                        slippers.
                        In this scheme, the person I always said 
                        “good morning” and “good bye” to
                        is no more.
                        The world has changed again.
