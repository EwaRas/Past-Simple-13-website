                <pre>
                        I used to pass out
                        poems
                        at lunch hour

                        a duct-taped knight
                        kneeling in the grass
                        crying

                        the most beautiful
                        things happened 
                        in my high school

                        blessed at an audacious 
                        edge               
                        where the parking lot 

                        ends
                        and the woods 
                        begin

                        hell we bled
                        and called it 
                        our senior song

                        wrote notes
                        on each other
                        ‘s bodies

                        unarchived
                        we died and
                        died and died 

                        ghost 
                        of my ghost
                        touch me
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>How to Drown</strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        you must love 
                        me like I love 

                        the sea 
                        a deep 

                        documentary 

                        breathe
                        breathe 

                        the waves 
                        what mercy 

                        cinematography
                        without light

                        life without you
                        you know who you are

                        is death
                        and the sea

                        is green
                    </pre>
                <h4><strong>The Invention of Night </strong></h4>
                <pre>
                        it is dark 
                        trying to find 
                        decency 
                        empathy
                        the stubborn vein 
                        of rage
                        something to surrender to
                        in the mirror
                        function of devices
                        amidst shopping sprees 
                        touch 
                        screens
                        the new fear
                        is spread
                        in infinite pixels
                        no wonder 
                        people worshiped 
                        the sun 
                        to know 
                        a thing
                        is just true 
                        blissfully subsumed 
                        by a singular source 
                        a color
                        a feeling
                        the grasses
                        whispering <em>here</em>
                        to the dew
                        what happened
                        to you?
                        meaning <em>me-you</em>
                        look at all this dark 
                        we gathered
                        lost godless 
                        doomed 
                        without 
                        even the bright 
                        light of a star 
                        gracing our face
