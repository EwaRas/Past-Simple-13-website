                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>EASTER</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">A start like a recipe for spring. I was going a long journey in a fast car. Everywhere there <br class="noBreakMobile">were clouds, I appreciated the value of the sun-roof. We passed some storks, so I said:</pre><br><br>   
                    <pre class="indent">look, storks. He said: you’re happy like a little kid. Stupid, I said, I’m happy like a little
                    kid, because you’re speaking to me like to a woman in April, be my friend, I want to be aglow
                    from that. Then</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">I called the witnesses on the spot, e-mails, ballets. All in pretty big quantities, because <br class="noBreakMobile">nothing stubbornly would do for me. Doesn’t matter, because the calendar resurrection’s on the <br class="noBreakMobile">way</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">for this I’ll bring the world a cheesecake.</pre>
                    <pre class="indent">Let them all love me, since you can’t.</pre><br>
                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>SUE RYDER FROM THE SQUARE</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="paragraphRight"><em>Sue Ryder – she encountered misfortune early on, when along with her
                    mother she visited hospitals and the gravely ill.</em>
                    <a href="www.dom-seniora.ovh.org">www.dom-seniora.ovh.org</a></pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Greetings to you, Sue Ryder from the square, on which no window of mine looks out. <br class="noBreakMobile">     Greetings to you, because I don’t want to go back to my place today. You’re in the snow, and I’m  <br class="noBreakMobile">in a strange kitchen, my dear Sue Ryder, in the Wild West.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Not long till high noon now, so I’m meeting you, we’re meeting, Sue Ryder, I’ll bring the <br class="noBreakMobile">cigarettes. Now I’m scraping paint from the windowsill with my nail, then I do it the other way <br class="noBreakMobile">round – do you like manicures? </pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">I like them though I shouldn’t, since it’s possible to do so many serious things, and here <br class="noBreakMobile">there’s the bishop’s violet in a brushstroke across the nail bed and you have to watch out for, fear <br class="noBreakMobile">the consequences. There awaits us, my dear, <em>a silent cloud in the earth</em></pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">-  the square behind the bus stop needs work. Dear Sue Ryder, and even then you can’t be <br class="noBreakMobile">sure, since the toilets by it will stay triangular – someone might find that ugly photo of you on <br class="noBreakMobile">google.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Greetings to you, Sue Rider, masterless cow-girl. Already we’re away from everywhere – <br class="noBreakMobile">the address books of mothers, our own beds, at the ends of the nerves of enemies from many <br class="noBreakMobile">nights, of brothers from just one.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Already we’re away from everywhere, so don’t look round, my sad Sue Ryder,</pre>
                    <pre class="indent">you’re nowhere to be found.</pre><br>
                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>POSSESSIONS</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">It was your evening, uneven boy. Your eyes get smaller as evening comes on. Long ago I <br class="noBreakMobile">was taught not to hold out my hand, so when I come home by some chance taxi, I’m thinking of <br class="noBreakMobile">kissing, thinking of the platforms we could say goodbye on, if by some miracle we’d met.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Oh, no exaggeration – I feel God’s will in these bright nights. But in my home, drought<br class="noBreakMobile">and withered ferns, no one calls by. To close my eyes here means to look at paws smeared with <br class="noBreakMobile">juicy fat, means to face up to the fancy floor above, means to horn over. You can come into me <br class="noBreakMobile">like into a swamp.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Uneven boy, right behind the lilac in the square – all my lymph; </pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">the shroud possessed from lips.</pre><br>
                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>TRUST TERRITORY</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">A dream of seven nails in the skull. I hesitate – for none of the possibilities is ready for <br class="noBreakMobile">sense. My father says: think, you don’t cry out. I say to my father: cry out, don’t think. I live free <br class="noBreakMobile">as the wind, she feeds me.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">And now look – I’ve picked up seven nails for my dance; seven guys from the Albatros <br class="noBreakMobile">and one dead girl. I lived over brow, over tit, over the wise stream, but the time came when they <br class="noBreakMobile">threw me out and led me to the field.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">And in the field the harness goes on. Hi hi, the harness goes on in the field. Long live <br class="noBreakMobile">want and barren sand! May the grains fall to the depths of the seas, may the ponds go down in <br class="noBreakMobile">algae and black duckweed! Here the earth’s only good for covering things up.</pre><br>
                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>LOCUS FOCUS</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">You were right barely to own up. At a distance your mother is cutting her hair very short <br class="noBreakMobile">again, though she’s still young, though when she visits parks, the ants use her thumbs as smooth
                    ladders.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">She waves to your father, in her hand she holds a handkerchief of lignin. Eternal farewell. <br class="noBreakMobile">Daughters are so goddam clever, when they don’t have kids or take a long time to graduate. Not <br class="noBreakMobile">her case, MA and children, virgin birth in action.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">But the butterflies from her belly live on distant meadows. Even the word meadow is said <br class="noBreakMobile">here with a light breath – like many other words that never get the right reflections. Creep off to <br class="noBreakMobile">the cellars, to the attics – on heated perches</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">your a-minor molecule passes the night, girl. In the darkness you shake, in the sun you<br class="noBreakMobile">over-expose these photos. So to rank fears – the word husband clearly goes to the head of the <br class="noBreakMobile">line, and over the head it’s better to draw that wisp of hair,</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">like when you wanted to kiss with some guarantee, but you didn’t have any - I don’t know <br class="noBreakMobile"> – charm, courage, fancy frock. Oh, I know – you prefer to stick pins in yourself,</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">because you alone know how far it is to the flowing life for which you’ve no proof. And <br class="noBreakMobile">though I bet you’re lying – you <em>are</em> lying. In some summer park, on a bench in the shade, you’re <br class="noBreakMobile">  poking at your eye with the forbidden splinter</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">and nothing changes.</pre><br>
                <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>HANDY-SIZED</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">A clot of color falls from the widow – to the scaffold to the scaffold. For when the cat <br class="noBreakMobile">comes to bed with its claws, when the fledgling chokes over the canal, the lizard wakes with a <br class="noBreakMobile">new tail, which really is no good – it gets light. Cover yourself with dark</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">up to the eyes, you crumb, go into town, into the world – look around a bit. On barges and <br class="noBreakMobile">rivers, coffee is drunk now, on the lawns ritual spreads. You will not catch yourself out – nothing <br class="noBreakMobile">can be undone. Look – it’s all gone, some rains,</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">books, clocks, some drownings in the bath, fingers round the throat. To be in your own <br class="noBreakMobile">place now in a city full of strangers, to look on as the boy with too long eye lashes longs to take <br class="noBreakMobile">  someone’s hand, but doesn’t reach out - and not to have any sympathy at all.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">To carry a well with you, best a handy-sized one.</pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">To use it according to need.</pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">To get rid of it according to dreams.</pre><br>
                <h4><strong>Driver’s License</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Strange these dates and strange the wood, strange winter sarcophagi of ants in it. You say: <br class="noBreakMobile">no ever died. I say: you can bang on about the hawthorn blossoming as much as you want, <br class="noBreakMobile">nothing will come of that, better get on to the car</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">and lay down our heads on the dash.</pre><br>
                <h4><strong>Orbi</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Such an inclination – not to value light and world. Of course, the albino stag steps through <br class="noBreakMobile">November, calamari are mostly smarter than cats and from another’s fingertip to the deeps</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">the sincerest scarab can reach. Of course, rain on the asphalt turns to mercury, mercury to <br class="noBreakMobile">a tear, a tear to a dream, a dream to a story of birds that over the body’s temperature cut all those <br class="noBreakMobile">spins,</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">and then peck your eyes and lips,</pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">your in-breath and out-breath.</pre><br>
                 <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>CONDITION</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">Hum me and rock me. Two strings – trusses and a question mark. Night on the ward, <br class="noBreakMobile">when – I confess – you were the only thread, the thin skin that the scabs holds on to.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">I thought my legs were gone: two hearts, two clear joys, that in the containers at the end <br class="noBreakMobile">of the tubes that grew out of me, I was gathering. O morphine – I had no fun with you.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">I’m talking about admitting. I admit – that chair is constantly changing signs. I lay down <br class="noBreakMobile">though I was still lying and then you lay down with me like in a fragrant sled. And now tell me:</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">what kind of happiness needs</pre><br>
                    <pre class="indent">a knife in the back and a dried-up river?</pre><br>
                  <h4 class="capitalize"><strong>FILLING IT UP</strong></h4><br>
                    <pre class="indent">It takes us – the time between.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">In the dream there was a banquet and leather – the string in the shoulders gave out no <br class="noBreakMobile"> sound, the asphalt hadn’t dried out yet, the cake clung to the fingers, the icing sugar to the chin. <br class="noBreakMobile">You had naked breasts and a tangled tongue in the middle of the do,</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">you danced, but afternoons <em>are</em> for the family. Tribute not fox trot – whoever doesn’t <br class="noBreakMobile">know that dies or suffers. So your heart full of aspen pins, so your head under the faucet, knees <br class="noBreakMobile">under the chin. And what would happen</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">if you could see more, if it was brighter. And so: flounder and visit parks, in cloudily-lit <br class="noBreakMobile">afternoons embroider peaces on others’ frames, gather air in the lungs of the vacuum and take off <br class="noBreakMobile">the example. So:</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">fill up the time between as tight as can be, so it doesn’t grab you.</pre><br><br>
                    <pre class="indent">And if it grabs you – drown.</pre><br>
