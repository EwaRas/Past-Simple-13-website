                    <pre>
                        Scenes of Rome and water faucet facing
                        the waves
                        pipped waves perhaps but sacred - they broke
                        the empire - I stood there leaning, watching
                        &amp; I had a coca-cola on my left hand - in the other a hanging device
                        a telescope to see the stars -
                        Babel Islands in the midst of spiders, tarantulas - evoking
                        predatory feelings, human feelings for forgetfulness -
                        freaky &amp; chic, cheeky freaks, these chicks - picking salt
                        like silk from where they got severe gastric problems -
                        I don't think I am any day closer to either sanity or insanity -
                        they run away from me, constantly,
                        it's them - not me.<br>
                        I die while I dye my hair - comb it to make it straight - never will be
                        I caress it but it keeps growing, grooving to its own rhythm.<br>
                        The night in Madrid is a cold canvas of light - all rubble intervenes,
                        intra veined by artists - nostalgia of revolutions in corners,
                        sharp edges, hedges, bathers in the hose of destiny - so hot!<br>
                        I miss, we miss, we missed, hissed like the sound of bullets flying
                        above bridges - satin sheets like in the song - sartorial feelings of madness<br>
                        silence, so prolonged - she was there
                        (no use to me) I was there too, just an embrace, a shoulder, three hundred
                        years in between - now i am speaking of someone else -<br>
                        then this girl forging my own purity wanting to be saved in a city
                        like this - no one there to witness the synthesis of time passing by, spaces
                        hollow - all we need is not love- that is all we don't need - it exists
                        by itself - all we need is a dictionary, and to memorize it<br>
                        words no longer valid to the prison of life - better  to write
                        than to say them - it's a clear day in my country - it's a clear country
                        in my day - it's clearness like it's the gloomy, encircling it:
                        country, street, ceiling,<br>
                        words of frontier, delimitation, central to discourse, to public discursivity -
                        the art of learning a mere word is sadly sailing away - let's find it.<br>
                        I sit and write - he writes to daddy, mummy - now a mummy
                        can't be that bad - lying down shot dead twice countries apart<br>
                        I write and sit - I spit, I wish these words were not so hermetic
                        I wish they taught me where to go - if we ever go anywhere -<br>
                        I have water, faucets running through my chest - captivity, cavern, grotto
                        (such loving word, Raquel) -<br>
                        it's seventy percent of it - a bundle of cells that carry themselves and how
                        come lungs don't get swollen by the sheer pleasure of drowning<br>
                        Look now I'm flying, it's a difficult art to master - being like a fly - coca cola
                        on one hand - in another a heavy tile, some words - a dictionary making me look
                        down on a page:<br>
                        be open, never take it personally
                        be personal, never take it openly<br>
                        or up the arse, they advise
                        and act like that:<br>
                        shall we join them now?

                <h4 class="capitalize">LIFE, AN IMPROVISATION</h4>
                    <pre>
                        (a dance poem for Hagit)<br>
                        In dance, like in life, it is always important to improvise. Do everything you can around
                        it - there are no mistakes, every movement is one -
                        when you are scared, look around and use what you've got, you'll always find
                        inspiration from people you know around you, from things - memory is a good thing to
                        exercise - if you are alone (you are never truly alone), think of people you know, or look
                        through the window, even a leaf falling will tell you what to do if you listen to it;
                        search , that's a vital activity in life, be curious - all will come your way if you discipline
                        curiosity, even if you find it hard in the beginning - tame the untamable, untame the
                        naturally tameable to you - be in the spot where life and death and the four elements
                        interact;
                        lift an arm with the same hard strength and soft candour you'd lower a leg - like
                        something had suddenly hit you
                        remember to use every inch of your body - the tiniest patch of skin is a sensitive spot
                        and has a movement of its own
                        let the intermediate slowly become the definitive - like the slightest action you make
                        would be your last<br>
                        stop, walk, stop and walk again - train the sudden, the surprise, teach your body to do
                        what your mind wants, and tell your mind your body is not an obstacle, and it can do
                        things the mind wouldn't think capable of  - nothing is an obstacle - all things exist and
                        are bound to interact with each other - get used to it
                        likewise space - there is no such thing as space - there is only the in between - to be
                        somewhere is a movement that will take you to another place (and another time) to tame
                        space is again to accept you cannot tame it - you adapt to the space you have and at time
                        you push it open<br>
                        breathing is essential - without it, you'd never survive, but too much will be poison, just
                        like water, just like the food that feeds the body -<br>
                        feel your breathing, let it flow out the same way it goes out - feel the transport, let
                        yourself transport in that flow and feel your lungs, right next to your heartbeat, fall in
                        love with your rib cage - and touch it, never be afraid to touch your breathing - it is not
                        abstract, it is more real than your body, because it is immerse in the infinite<br>
                        there is no such thing as separation between normal life and dance, forget all these
                        commandments and just make them your own - life is dance and dance is life - not even
                        sides of the same coin - our life is what we do with it, so learn that sometimes we need
                        to be real slow, then real fast - but the best thing, the thing you should never forget is to
                        always move towards the light, even if you have to go back, to darkness, if you need to 
                        relearn what light is.<br>
                        Finally, repetition is always possible, like redemption, it is the path that leads to light -
                        so read this all over till you know every movement of these words by heart, that is, till
                        you know it in your heart.
